## Description

The GET param `page` is the path of the .php file to be served. There is then an opportunity to type in a different path. An interesting way to exploit this vulnerability is to steal the file containing the server's passwords. All we have to do is going back to the root of the server with a lot of "../" and then picking the /etc/passwd file. You can for example try with this url : 

`/index.php?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

In this case, the pages' files could for example be located at : 

`/var/www/html/borntosec/src/page/page.php`

This method is known as Path Traversal.

## How to prevent it ?

A way to avoid having such a vulnerability in your web-app could be to have a list of allowed pages on your server, if the string from the GET param is not included in this list, simply don't serve the file. You can also set up the `.htaccess` to deny all access to the files which are out of the directory containing the .php files. In addition to this, if a page should be accessible to some users only, you can restrict the access on the server too.
