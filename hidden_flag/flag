In order to find this flag you have to search through all the urls of the /.hidden route.
hidden.js will loop through all the directories and append the content of each README, along with the file's url.
hidden.txt now contains all the information we need.
parse.js will finish the work and filter the irrelevant lines to print only the flag.
